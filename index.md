Hi, welcome to my personal page. I'm a second year Ph.D Student at <a href="https://sis.smu.edu.sg/programmes/PhD/overview" target="_blank">School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University</a>. At SIS, I'm fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/lxjiang/" target="_blank">Prof. Lingxiao Jiang</a>. </p>
## Background
<p align="justify" style="max-width:600px">
I obtained a Bachelor Degree in <a href="http://www.apcs.hcmus.edu.vn/Default.aspx?alias=www.apcs.hcmus.edu.vn/en" target="_blank">Advanced Program Computer Science</a>, which is a honour program at <a href="http://web.hcmus.edu.vn/en/index.php" target="_blank">Ho Chi Minh University of Science</a>. At HCMUS, I conducted my thesis under the supervision of <a href="https://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinh:Tien_Ba">Prof. Dinh Ba Tien</a>. After that, I worked as a software engineer in the industry for 3 years.
</p>
## Research Interests
<p align="justify" style="max-width:600px">
My interests lie at the intersection of Software Mining, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning. I am interested in employing the power of Machine Learning to software engineering and programming languages to solve challenging software engineering problem.
</p>
## Projects
<p align="justify" style="max-width:600px">
I'm focusing on employing the theory of graph-based and tree-based modeling for programming languages. Programming languages, as well as natural languages, are both considered as the sequence of text. But the programming languages expose a richer structural information than text in a form of the AST tree. In addition, the components in the AST tree are well-connected with each other through many form of dependencies, such as def-use, control flow, data flow. As such, the source code of programming languages can also be described in the form of graphs. This leads to the consequence that modeling source code using a tree-based model or graph-based model usually can produce richer and more useful features than the sequence-based model. The features extracted can be useful in tasks, such as program classification, variable naming, variable misuse detection, etc.
