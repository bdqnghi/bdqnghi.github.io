## About
I completed the Ph.D in Computer Science (June-2020) at <a href="https://sis.smu.edu.sg/programmes/PhD/overview" target="_blank">School of Computing & Information Systems (SCIS), Singapore Management University (SMU)</a> (**Rank 81 Overrall, Rank 10** in Software Engineering Research on  <a href="http://csrankings.org/#/index?soft&world" target="_blank">CSRanking</a>) and a Bachelor in Computer Science at Ho Chi Minh University of Science (2013). 

During my Ph.D, I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/lxjiang/" target="_blank"> Prof. Lingxiao Jiang</a>. I also received tremendous guidance from <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/people/yy66" target="_blank">Prof.Yijun Yu</a> from The Open University, UK. I was grateful to receive the  <a href="https://graduatestudies.smu.edu.sg/phd/singapore-management-university-smu-phd-financial-assistance-schemes#computing" target="_blank"> Presidential Doctoral Fellowship in Computing</a> and the SMU Dean's List for outstanding research achievement.  I am the first author of a few publications in **top-tier academic conferences** across different domains in Computer Science, such as software engineering (<a href="http://www.icse-conferences.org/" target="_blank">ICSE</a> , <a href="https://www.esec-fse.org" target="_blank">ESEC/FSE</a>,  <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/series/ase" target="_blank">ASE</a>), artificial intelligence (<a href="https://www.aaai.org/Conferences/conferences.php" target="_blank">AAAI</a>), natural language processing (<a href="https://2022.emnlp.org/" target="_blank">EMNLP</a>), information retrieval (<a href="https://sigir.org/" target="_blank">SIGIR</a>).

## Research Interests

My interests lie at the intersection of Software Engineering, Deep Learning, Programming Languages and Natural Language Processing. Specifically, I am interested in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve challenging problems for software systems (aka **Machine Learning for Code**), such as **code generation, code search, code summarization, program synthesis, automated bug detection & program repair, code migration, AI-based software testing, etc**. Towards the goal of automated programming, my primary focus of research is to study large scale, free source code data (Big Code) that is freely accessible on Github, Bitbucket, etc., to better understand the behaviors of software systems, and to adapt recent advances in Deep Learning, such as Graph Neural Networks, Large Language Models (GPT, T5, BERT), Causal AI, to mine knowledge from these systems. This is a step forward in reducing software maintenance costs, and help software developers to write and understand source code better. 

More details of my research can be found in my [Github](https://github.com/bdqnghi){:target="_blank"}.
