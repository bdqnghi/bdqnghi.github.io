I'm a third-year Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at <a href="https://sis.smu.edu.sg/programmes/PhD/overview" target="_blank">School of Information Systems (SIS), Singapore Management University (SMU)</a>. I received the SMU full scholarship and started my Ph.D in August, 2016. At SIS, I'm fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/lxjiang/" target="_blank">Associate Prof. Lingxiao Jiang</a>. I'm also working closely with <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/people/yy66" target="_blank">Prof.Yijun Yu</a> from <a href="http://mcs.open.ac.uk/yy66/index.php" target="_blank">The Open University, UK</a>.
## Research Interests

I am interested in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve challenging problems for software systems (aka **Machine Learning for Code**). My primary focus of research is to analyze source code data from software programs to better understand its behaviors, and propose the Machine Learning model to mine knowledge from existing software artifacts as a stage forward to reduce software maintenance cost, and help software developers to understand the source code better. This field has a wide range of applications, such as:
- Code Summarization: to generate the documentation for source code automatically.
- Program Translation: to translate (or migrate a program from one language to another)
- Bug Detection: to identify the buggy part of the software
- Code Generation: to generate the source code given certain information, e.g. natural language text instruction
- Code Search: to enable searching on the large codebase, which makes it easier for the developer to maintain the source code.

Concretely, in my Ph.D. Thesis, I'm focusing on answering the two fundamental questions:
- **How to build good representation learning models for source code?** 
Recently, many works proposed to use Deep Learning to solve a wide range of software engineering tasks. But, Deep Learning alone is not enough to learn the rich structural and semantic features that hide inside the code. As such, my goal is to combine Deep Learning and Program Analysis to leverage the best of both that can lift up the performance of a specific software engineering task.
- **How can we properly interpret the Deep Learning models that are used for source code modeling?** 
Despite widespread adoption, Deep Learning (DL) models remain mostly black boxes. The problem is even more severe in the software engineering field, where most of the DL-based model is built based on some human heuristics with try and error. Understanding the reasons and able to interpret the predictions is quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction. I'm doing some studies to find the connection between the human and the DL-based model on how they understand the source code.
