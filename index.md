I'm a third-year Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at <a href="https://sis.smu.edu.sg/programmes/PhD/overview" target="_blank">School of Information Systems (SIS), Singapore Management University (SMU)</a>. I received the SMU full scholarship and started my Ph.D in August, 2016. At SIS, I'm fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/lxjiang/" target="_blank">Associate Prof. Lingxiao Jiang</a>. I'm also working closely with <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/people/yy66" target="_blank">Prof.Yijun Yu</a> from <a href="http://mcs.open.ac.uk/yy66/index.php" target="_blank">The Open University, UK</a>.
## Research Interests

I am interested in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve challenging problems for software systems (aka **Machine Learning for Code**). My primary focus of research is to analyze source code data from software programs to better understand its behaviors, and propose the Machine Learning model to mine knowledge from existing software artifacts as a stage forward to reduce software maintenance cost, and help software developers to understand the source code better. This field has a wide range of applications, such as:
- Code Summarization: to generate the documentation for source code automatically.
- Program Translation: to translate (or migrate a program from one language to another)
- Bug Detection: to identify the buggy part of the software
- Code Generation: to generate the source code given certain information, e.g. natural language text instruction
- Code Search: to enable searching on the large codebase, which makes it easier for the developer to maintain the source code.
