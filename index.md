Hi, welcome to my personal page. I'm a third year Ph.D Candidate at <a href="https://sis.smu.edu.sg/programmes/PhD/overview" target="_blank">School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University (SIS)</a>. I started my Ph.D at August, 2016. At SIS, I'm fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/lxjiang/" target="_blank">Associate Prof. Lingxiao Jiang</a>.

I obtained a Bachelor Degree in <a href="http://www.apcs.hcmus.edu.vn/Default.aspx?alias=www.apcs.hcmus.edu.vn/en" target="_blank">Advanced Program Computer Science</a>, which is a honour program at <a href="http://web.hcmus.edu.vn/en/index.php" target="_blank">Ho Chi Minh University of Science</a>. At HCMUS, I conducted my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of <a href="https://dblp.org/pers/hd/d/Dinh:Tien_Ba">Prof. Dinh Ba Tien</a>. After that, I worked as a software engineer in the industry for 3 years.
