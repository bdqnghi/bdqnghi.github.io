My research focuses on the application of machine learning into software engineering tasks. More broadly, my interests lie at the intersection of Software Mining, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning. In details, I am focusing on employing the power of Machine Learning to software engineering and programming languages to create smart software engineering tools for developers. 

In this era, software data is ubiquitous. These data is available puclicly on Github, Jira, Bitbucket, etc. These system publicly expose not just source code, but also meta-data concerning authorship, but-fixes and review processes. The scale of available data is massive: billions of tokens of code and millions of instances of meta-data. This abundance of massive code data suggests a new, data-driven approach to develop software tools. With the promise and power of Machine Learning on its ability to generalize from examples and handle noise, along with predictive power, it is quite obvious that we can leverage the power of Machine Learning to exploit such massive dataset to get valuable information to enhance the usability of software development tools.
